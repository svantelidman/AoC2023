# AoC2023
My solutions for Advent of Code 2023

Goals:
* Do it in Rust (again)
* Enjoy it
* Finish all days (eventually). Unlikely that it will be done by the 25th. Some time in January is probably realistic.
* Reasonably readable code
* No peeking in the reddit thread
* No use of generative AI

Non goals:
* Being super fast
* Optimal solutions, if I get occassionally only find a solution that converges in 60 minutes or less that is fine
